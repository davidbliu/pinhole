<h1>Our Pinhole Camera</h1>

<h2>Observations</h2>
<b>What happens at different pinhole diameters?</b>

<h1>Scene 1</h1>
<p>We took our first scene shots near the student center.</p>
<img src = './photos/scene1_9.JPG'/>
Scene 1 taken at pinhole diameter of 0.9 mm, exposure 30 seconds, ISO 2000, aperture f/4.0
<img src = './photos/scene1_6.JPG'/>
Scene 1 taken at pinhole diameter of 0.6 mm, exposure 30 seconds, ISO 2000, aperture f/4.0
<img src = './photos/scene1_4.JPG'/>
Scene 1 taken at pinhole diameter of 0.4 mm, exposure 30 seconds, ISO 2000, aperture f/4.0.
The image is much sharper but slightly dimmer than the images created using larger pinhole diameters

<h1>Scene 2</h1>
<p>We took our first scene shots near the student center.</p>
<img src = './photos/scene2_9.JPG'/>
Scene 2 taken at pinhole diameter of 0.9 mm, exposure 30 seconds, ISO 2000, aperture f/4.0
<img src = './photos/scene2_6.JPG'/>
Scene 2 taken at pinhole diameter of 0.6 mm, exposure 30 seconds, ISO 2000, aperture f/4.0
<img src = './photos/scene2_4.JPG'/>
Scene 2 taken at pinhole diameter of 0.4 mm, exposure 30 seconds, ISO 2000, aperture f/4.0.
The image is much sharper but slightly dimmer than the images created using larger pinhole diameters

<h1>Additional images</h1>
<p>We took 4 additional scenes with our best pinhole choice. The additional images were taken with 0.9 mm pinhole diameter.
